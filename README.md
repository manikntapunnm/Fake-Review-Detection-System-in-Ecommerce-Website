# Fake-Review-Detection-System-in-Ecommerce-Website


The "Fake Review Detection System in E-commerce Website" is a Java web application developed using core Java, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition). The development environment for this application is Apache NetBeans.

Key components and features of the system likely include:

Core Java:

The foundational programming language for developing the backend logic of the application.
JSP (JavaServer Pages):

Used for creating dynamic web pages with Java code embedded in HTML. JSP allows for the seamless integration of Java code with the presentation layer.
J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition):

A set of specifications that extends the Java platform to support large-scale, distributed, and multi-tiered applications. J2EE is likely used to build scalable and robust enterprise-level components.
Apache NetBeans:

The integrated development environment (IDE) utilized for building, testing, and deploying the Java web application. Apache NetBeans provides a user-friendly environment for Java development.
Fake Review Detection:

The primary functionality of the system is likely centered around detecting fake reviews on an e-commerce website. This could involve the analysis of various factors such as review patterns, language used, or user behavior to identify potentially fraudulent reviews.
Web Application:

Being a web application, the system is accessible through a web browser. Users can interact with the application's features through a user-friendly interface.
Apache Tomcat (Assumed):

Apache Tomcat, a widely used Java Servlet container, might be employed to deploy and run the Java web application.
Database Integration:

The application likely interacts with a database to store and retrieve data related to reviews, users, and other relevant information.
Security Measures:

Given the sensitivity of user reviews, the system may implement security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
Scalability and Performance:

J2EE and associated technologies are chosen to ensure the application's scalability and performance, making it suitable for handling a large number of users and data.
In summary, this Java web application is designed to enhance the integrity of an e-commerce platform by implementing a Fake Review Detection System. It utilizes core Java, JSP, and J2EE in the Apache NetBeans development environment to provide a robust and scalable solution for identifying and managing fake reviews on the platform.
